Task:
  Given the meal price (base cost of a meal),
  tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip),
  and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal,
  find and print the meal's total cost.

  tax_amount = meal_cost * tax_percent / 100
  total_cost = round(meal_cost + tip_amount + tax_amount)
  print(f'âž¡ Total Cost: {total_cost}')
